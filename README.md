# Tower defense
Tower defense is a project developed in Python programing as a project for a Software design class at Insper by by Victor Vergara Arcoverde de Albuquerqye Cavalcanti and Ramon Menegatto with the assitance of Professor Andrew Toshiaki Nakayama Kurauchi and Assistant Professor BÃ¡rbara Tieko Agena.

Next steps for the completion of the game include: Making the scoreboar appear on top of the map, and not bellow as it is now, adding different towers and mobs, for the game to become more active and strategy minded, and add a difficulty menu, which would slow the mobs down, it is possible to do it manually by just changing the FPS variable.

If you have any feedback, such as tips, ideas, or just your opinios be sure to send us an e-mail at vvergara@uol.com.br

PS: The most recent updated version of the game probably is the game.py,so we sugest playing in that version.
